This is the /steps folder. It is meant to be used as a supplement to the workshop and/or video depending on which one you are viewing! 

I thought it would be cool to add some slight customizations on top of pointer.gg's course, without going over the top to take up too much of anyone's time.

Each folder should be labeled by the number of the step that I designated it during the presentation (or presentation video, which will be up on YT in the future).
